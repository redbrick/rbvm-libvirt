rbvmctl is the rbvm command line utility. Any of the following subcommands
will work:

    listusers       Displays a list of users.
    resetpw         Allows a user's password to be reset.
    help            Displays help information.

To get more information on a specific item, run 'rbvmctl help topicname',
where topicname is one of the commands listed above.
"""

usage['listusers'] = """
The listusers command will display a table of users registered with the
system, and their email addresses. There are no extra arguments or options
for this command.
"""

usage['listvms'] = """
The listvms command will display a table of virtual machines on the system.
The following columns are given:

    ID              A unique numeric identifier given to each VM.
    VM name         A descriptive name given to a VM. This may be modified by
                    the user through the web interface.
    Username        The username of the user to whom this VM belongs.
    Status          The current detected status (powered on or powerd off) of
                    this VM.
    PID             The last known process ID of this virtual machine on the
                    host system. If the VM is powered off, this is the PID
                    that was set the last time the VM ran.

The showips argument can be given to show an extra column giving the assigned
IP addresses on each VM.
"""

usage['resetpw'] = """
The resetpw command allows a user's password to be reset. The new password
will be generated at random and will automatically be emailed to the address
associated with that user in the database. Use the listusers command to view
the information on file for each user.

The resetpw command requires an argument specifying the username of the user
whose password is to be reset. For example:

rbvmctl resetpw bob

will reset the password for the user 'bob'.
"""

usage['help'] = """
Are you serious?
"""

usage['showvm'] = """
Displays detailed technical information on a virtual machine. The showvm
command requires an argument specifying the numeric identifier associated
with the VM. To get a list of identifiers, use the listvms command.
"""

usage['changename'] = """
The changename command allows a VM name to be changed.

The changename command requires two arguments. The first is the VM ID number,
as shown in the output of listvms. The second is the new name for the VM.
For example:

rbvmctl changename 1 "New name"

will change the name of VM 1 to "new name".
"""

usage['changeip'] = """
The changeip command allows a VM IP address to be changed.

The changeip command requires two arguments. The first is the VM ID number,
as shown in the output of listvms. The second is the new name for the VM.
For example:

rbvmctl changeip 1 192.168.0.10

will change the assigned IP address of VM 1 to 192.168.0.10.

The command will object if you try to assign an IP that has been taken by
another virtual machine. To continue in spite of these objections, use the
force (-f, or --force) option.
"""

usage['register'] = """
The register command allows a domain (VM) created using an external libvirt
tool to be registered to a user with RBVM.

Three arguments are required: The address of the hypervisor on which the
virtual machine was created, the virtual machine's UUID and the RBVM username
of whoever is to have control over it. For example:

rbvmctl register qemu:///system 48ee8e34-3eda-11e1-9b5c-00508d954ae7 bob

will assign the virtual machine on the hypervisor at qemu:///system with the
UUID 48ee8e34-3eda-11e1-9b5c-00508d954ae7 to the user bob.
